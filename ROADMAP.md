# Roadmap

### Jan 30, 2025
I need a place to put my ideas so this will be it.

### Features
- [X] Replace GCP upload to reading the repo locally
- [X] Can read .gitignore that are in nested directories
- [ ] Create a PGVectorStore class
- [ ] Auto-release to pypi on merge to main

### Housekeeping
- [X] Centrealize config management instead of spread across many files to make it easier for customers to customize their own config
- [ ] Centralize the use of parallel processing instead of replicating it in many places
- [X] Create a VectorDatabaseOperation interface
