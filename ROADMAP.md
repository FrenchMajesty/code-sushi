# Roadmap

### Jan 30, 2025
I need a place to put my ideas so this will be it.

### Features
- [ ] Replace GCP upload to reading the repo locally
- [ ] Can read .gitignore that are in nested directories
- [ ] Create a PGVectorStore class

### Housekeeping
- [ ] Centrealize config management instead of spread across many files to make it easier for customers to customize their own config
- [ ] Create interfaces to have abstract base classes for modularity
- [ ] Centralize the use of parallel processing instead of replicating it in many places
- [ ] Create a VectorDatabaseOperation interface
- [ ] Create LanguageModelOperation interface
- [ ] Create a TreeSitterProcessor class to maintain state
